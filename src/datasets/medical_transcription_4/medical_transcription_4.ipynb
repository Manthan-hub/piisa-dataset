The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable.  The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors.  At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm.  Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors.  The mucosa within the hernia was normal.  The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout.  The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion.  During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia.  It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter.  When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one.  No stretching of the mucosa took place.  The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Esophagitis.,2.

The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE: , Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.,The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.,All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  ,None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.surgery, sacroiliac joint pain, sacroiliac, teflon coated needle, fluoroscopy, needle placement, radiofrequency ablation, ablation, tissue, lidocaine, needle,\"}\n",

She denied history of chest pain or fevers or cough with purulent sputum at that time. She was empirically treated with a course of antibiotics of Avelox for ten days. She also received steroids, prednisolone 60 mg, and breathing treatments with albuterol, Ipratropium and her bronchodilator therapy was also optimized with theophylline. She continued to receive Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate was controlled and was maintained in the 60s-70s. On the third day of admission she developed worsening respiratory failure with fatigue, and hence was required to be intubated and ventilated. She was put on mechanical ventilation from 1/29 to 2/6/06. She was extubated on 2/6 and put on BI-PAP. The pressures were gradually increased from 10 and 5 to 15 of BI-PAP and 5 of E-PAP with FIO2 of 35% at the time of transfer to Kindred.

EOM was full and smooth and without nystagmus. Goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot OD and OS (OD worse) with a normal periphery.

Facial sensation was decreased on the right side (V1 distribution).,Motor/Sensory/Coord/Station/Gait: were all unremarkable.,Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout.

The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses.,It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma.,The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92.
